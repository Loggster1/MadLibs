# About The Project
This is an interactive MadLibs game built in Java. Users will be prompted to enter different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), and then a random story will be generated with those inputs. It's a great way to practice creativity and have some fun. Right now it doesn't have a GUI, so the user interacts with it via command line.

# Features
| Features | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Story Generation** | User inputs different words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) to complete a story template. |
| **Multiple Stories** | Includes multiple stories to generate a variety of madlibs. To add your own, follow the structure of an already created file and add it to your MadLibsFiles folder |
| **Interactive CLI** | User-friendly command-line interface where users input words and receive their unique story. |
