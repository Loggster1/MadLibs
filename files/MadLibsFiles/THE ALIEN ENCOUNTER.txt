One evening, [blank] was stargazing when a/an [blank] spaceship  
descended from [blank]. It glowed [blank] and made a loud "[blank]" sound.  

The hatch opened, and out came three [blank] aliens with giant [blank]!  
They spoke in a strange language that sounded like "[blank]."  
One alien held up [blank] fingers and then [blank] at [blank]'s  
[blank].  

Nervously, [blank] reached out and handed over a/an [blank].  
The alien studied it, then suddenly yelled, "[blank]!" and  
vanished into thin air. Guess weâ€™ll never know what they wanted!
