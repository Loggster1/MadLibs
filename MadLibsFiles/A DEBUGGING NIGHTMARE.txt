It was 2 AM, and [blank] was deep in the trenches of [blank] programming.  
Their [blank] code was supposed to print "Hello, World!", but instead, it  
outputted a [blank]. Frustrated, they [blank] through their [blank] editor,  
only to be met with the dreaded "[blank]" error on line [blank].  

"This makes no sense," they muttered, feeling completely [blank].  
They Googled the error and found a Stack Overflow post from 2011  
saying, "[blank]." Of course, that didn’t help.  

After hours of debugging, they finally realized they had forgotten  
to close their [blank]. They quickly [blank] the missing [blank] and  
re-ran the code. Suddenly, everything worked!  

Feeling like a true [blank], they [blank] their project and declared,  
"This code is finally [blank]!"—only to hear a loud "[blank]!"  
as their IDE crashed.
