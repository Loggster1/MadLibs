Welcome to **Cooking with [blank]**, the most [blank]  
show on television!  

Today, we’re making [blank] with a side of [blank]. First,  
you take a [blank] and add exactly [blank] cups of it to the [blank].  

After that, we [blank] everything together until it looks like  
something [blank] would approve of. Finally, we [blank] it in  
the oven and wait.  

"[blank]!" We may have overcooked it—at least according to my  
[blank], which is now completely [blank].  

Join us next week when we attempt to [blank] without setting the  
kitchen on fire!
