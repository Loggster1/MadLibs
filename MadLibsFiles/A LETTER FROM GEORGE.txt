Hello, my fellow [blank] in 2022, it's me, George Washington,
the first [blank]. I am writing from (the) [blank], where I 
have been secretly living for the past [blank] years. I am
concerned by the [blank] state of affairs in America these days. 
It	seems	that	your	politicians	are	more	concerned	with
[blank] one another than with listening to the [blank] of the 
people. When we declared our independence from (the) [blank] , 
we set forth on a/an [blank] path guided by the voices of the 
everyday [blank]. If we're going to keep [blank], then we 
need to learn how to respect all [blank]. Don't get me wrong; 
we had [blank] problems in my day, too. Benjamin Franklin once 
called me a/an [blank] and kicked me in the [blank]. But at the 
end of the day, we were able to [blank] in harmony. Let us find 
that [blank] spirit once again, or else I'm taking my [blank] 
off the quarter!
