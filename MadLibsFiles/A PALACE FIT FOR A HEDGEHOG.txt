Sonic's abode is a very [blank] place. At first glance, it seems like
a/an [blank] cave, but if you look closer, you'll see it's actually a
comfortable [blank].   For one, Sonic has a super-cozy beanbag [blank].
When he feels like listening to some [blank] tunes from the 1980s, Sonic
turns on his old-school [blank], pulls out his collection of [blank] and
jams out. In addition to great tunes, Sonic has plenty of [blank]
equipment to keep him busy. There's a dryer that Sonic uses as a treadmill
to run [blank] miles a day. He has a/an [blank] Ping-Pong table where he
plays against . . . himself. (His  record is [blank] wins and zero losses!)
And for that final touch, Sonic hung [blank] all over his cave walls. He's 
got a/an [blank] photo of (the) [blank] next to a/an [blank] poster
of [blank]. It may not be much, but Sonic loves to  [blank]
in his cave all the time!
